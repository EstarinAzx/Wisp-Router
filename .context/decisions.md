# Decisions

Settled questions. Append-only. Each entry is dated.

## 2026-06-10 — Inline-completion design review

1. **Latency target ~0.5–1.5s (regime B).** Chat-on-Zen cannot hit sub-100ms FIM speed; that is accepted, not a bug. Shapes everything below.
2. **Adaptive short completions: `maxTokens` 64, no hard newline-stop.** Keeps p50 latency in budget while still allowing 2–3 line blocks. _Why:_ a newline-stop would kill legit multi-line like `if (x) {`.
3. **Non-streaming.** The VS Code inline API resolves a suggestion once, so streaming gives no perceived-latency win; only complexity. Revisit only if p95 annoys.
4. **API key in SecretStorage + `OPENCODE_API_KEY` env fallback; no plaintext setting.** _Why:_ a `settings.json` key leaks via Settings Sync / screen-share.
5. **Default model `opencode/minimax-m3` + per-request latency log + `listModels` command.** _Why:_ it's the id proven working against `go/v1` in the reference `llm-provider`; pick the real winner (`glm-5` / `kimi-k2.6`?) from the logged data. Model stays a setting.
6. **Trigger gating (sensible, not aggressive):** skip on empty/whitespace prefix, active selection, and native-IntelliSense-open (`selectedCompletionInfo`). _Why:_ no language-aware string/comment parsing — too brittle across languages.
7. **Single-entry last-result cache.** _Why:_ the dominant waste is same-position re-fires (VS Code re-queries on cursor moves/re-renders); one entry erases it cheaply.
8. **Status-bar heartbeat (ready/thinking/disabled/error), click toggles enabled.** _Why:_ regime-B latency is felt; the user needs "working vs frozen" signal.
9. **Strip prefix-overlap before returning.** _Why:_ chat models often echo the current line → doubled ghost text; the system prompt alone doesn't prevent it.

## 2026-06-10 — Side-panel feature (planned)

10. **Panel scope = key + model + enabled toggle.** Other settings stay in `settings.json`. _Why:_ matches the ask plus the one cheap, useful toggle; avoids scope creep into a full control center.
11. **Model picker = live `/models` list + free-text override + refresh.** _Why:_ discovery without locking the user out of unadvertised ids; manual field still works without a valid key.
12. **Stack = Preact + Tailwind v4, bundled by Vite into one unhashed asset; deprecated webview-ui-toolkit avoided (theme via `--vscode-*` vars).**
13. **Key is write-only from the webview** — UI sends the key, receives only `keyIsSet`, never the value back.
14. **Tests marked for the pure modules M1 (suggestion cleanup) + M2 (completion context)** — see `PRD.md`. M3–M6 are VS Code/DOM glue → manual/integration verify.
15. **PRD delivered as `PRD.md` in-repo** (project is greenfield / non-git at decision time, so a local doc is the "copy", not a GitHub issue).
