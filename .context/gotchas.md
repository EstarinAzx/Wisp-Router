# Gotchas

### No fill-in-middle (FIM) on the Zen endpoint
The provider exposes **only** OpenAI-compatible chat completions — there is no FIM/`suffix`/completion route. The extension prompts a *chat* model to act as a completer (`prefix<CURSOR>suffix` → return only the insertion). Don't go looking for a FIM endpoint to "do it properly"; it doesn't exist. This is the root reason latency is ~0.5–1.5s, not sub-100ms.

### Chat models echo the current line → doubled ghost text
A chat model frequently returns the line it's completing (`const x = ` → `const x = 42`), which renders as `const x = const x = 42`. The `stripPrefixOverlap` step in `src/extension.ts` trims the longest prefix-tail the suggestion repeats. The system prompt alone does **not** prevent this — keep the trim.

### Debounce is the cancellation token, not a manual timer
The provider `await delay(debounceMs)` then checks `token.isCancellationRequested`. VS Code cancels the token on the next keystroke, so abandoned requests bail before hitting the network. Don't "fix" this into a standalone debounce timer — it would double-fire.

### Webview CSP × Tailwind v4
With a Vite **production** build, Tailwind compiles to a static linked stylesheet — no runtime `<style>` injection — so a strict CSP (`script-src 'nonce-…'; style-src ${cspSource}`) is enough. Only add `'unsafe-inline'` to `style-src` if the webview devtools console actually reports a violation. Don't pre-emptively loosen it.

### Two TypeScript configs must stay separate
The extension `tsconfig.json` keeps `include: ["src"]`. The webview's JSX lives under `webview/` with its **own** tsconfig (`jsx: react-jsx`, `jsxImportSource: preact`). If the extension `tsc` ever picks up the webview files it will fail on browser JSX/DOM types. `compile` runs both (`tsc -p ./ && tsc -p webview && vite build`) — Vite's esbuild transform does **not** type-check, so without the `tsc -p webview` step webview type errors ship silently.

### Vite asset names must be deterministic
The extension references the webview bundle by fixed path (`main.js` / `main.css`). The Vite config must disable hashing (`entryFileNames`/`assetFileNames` pinned, `cssCodeSplit:false`, `inlineDynamicImports:true`). Default hashed names will 404 in the webview.

### Config writes must target the defining scope, not always Global
`setModel`/`setEnabled` use `cfg().inspect()` to write the scope that already defines the value. A blind `ConfigurationTarget.Global` write under a workspace override is silently ineffective and the controlled panel select/checkbox snaps back. See `targetFor()` in `src/extension.ts`.

### Server error bodies can leak the key — sanitize before posting to the webview
`fetchModelIds` failures must not forward raw `String(err)` to the panel: OpenAI-style 401 bodies echo key fragments (`Incorrect API key provided: sk-…`). `sanitizeError` in `src/sidePanelProvider.ts` maps to a status-code string. The write-only-key rule covers error text too.

### Key is write-only across the webview boundary
Never post the API key value back to the webview — only a `keyIsSet` boolean. Invalidate the cached OpenAI client whenever the key is set or cleared.

### Model ids are BARE on `zen/go/v1` — the `opencode/` prefix is rejected
The chat endpoint returns `401 Model opencode/minimax-m3 is not supported` for a provider-prefixed id. Use the **bare** id exactly as `GET /models` serves it (`minimax-m3`, `glm-5`, `kimi-k2.6`, …). `DEFAULT_MODEL`, the setting default, and `fetchModelIds` must all stay bare. The `opencode/<id>` form (from the reference `llm-provider` and the public docs) does **not** work against this gateway — it had inline completions silently erroring the whole time. See [[decisions]].

### Served models are reasoning models — strip `<think>` and DON'T cap tokens
Most `zen/go` ids (minimax-m3, mimo, qwen3*, glm5*) emit chain-of-thought **inline** in the completion as `<think>…</think>`, then the real answer. Two consequences: (1) `stripThink` in `src/extension.ts` must drop the block (and treat an unterminated `<think>` as "no answer yet" → insert nothing) or the ghost text is the model's thinking; (2) a low `max_tokens` cap starves the answer — the model spends the budget thinking and never reaches code. `maxTokens` default is therefore `0` (uncapped); `max_tokens` is omitted from the request unless set `>0`. For snappy completions use a non-reasoning id (`deepseek-v4-flash`, `kimi-k2.6`). See [[decisions]].

### Output-channel logs persist on disk — read them to debug a user's error
`OutputChannel` content is written to `%APPDATA%\Code\logs\<session>\window<n>\exthost\output_logging_<ts>\<n>-Wisp.log`. When the user can't surface the Output panel, glob the newest matching file and grep `[error]` instead of walking them through the UI. This is how the `401 … not supported` cause was found.

### Comment-line guard fires only on WHOLE-LINE comments at the true end of line
`relocateAfterComment` (`src/extension.ts`) stops the model from continuing a comment line. Its gates
are load-bearing, not incidental: (1) the comment token must be the **first non-whitespace char** of the
line — a `//`/`#` *anywhere* on the line false-positives on URLs (`https://`), regex (`/\/\//`), shell
`${var#…}`, YAML `url#frag`, and Python docstring/JSDoc body text; (2) only **known code languages**
fire (the `LINE_COMMENT` map) — the provider matches every file (`**`), so defaulting `//` onto
markdown/plaintext/json mangles prose; (3) end-of-line is **strict** (`position.character === line.length`),
not `trim()`-based — a trailing space with the caret before it means the user is mid-authoring. Don't
"simplify" any of these to `indexOf` / a `//` default / a trimmed check — each reopens a false-positive
class the adversarial pass already found. **Block comments (`/* */`, JSDoc `* …`) are intentionally
unguarded** (only single-line comments trigger the bug; an unterminated `/*` would misdetect). The guard
fails safe — when unsure it returns the suggestion unchanged and never drops code. See [[decisions]].

### Packaging ships node_modules — bundling is optional (size only)
**Empirically verified:** `vsce package` includes production `dependencies`, so `node_modules/openai` is inside the `.vsix` and the extension runs installed without esbuild/webpack. (The earlier claim that it "won't ship without bundling" was wrong.) Bundling remains worth doing later to shrink the package — the unbundled `.vsix` is ~1402 files / 2.33 MB and vsce warns about it — but it is not a correctness blocker.
