# Bare model ids required (corrects decision #5)

**Decision:** Model ids for `zen/go/v1` are **bare** (`minimax-m3`), never provider-prefixed (`opencode/minimax-m3`). `DEFAULT_MODEL`, the `wisp.model` default, and `fetchModelIds` all use/return the bare form exactly as `GET /models` serves it.
**Why:** the chat endpoint returns `401 Model opencode/minimax-m3 is not supported` for the prefixed form. This **falsifies decision #5's** claim that `opencode/minimax-m3` was "proven working" — that was inherited from the reference `llm-provider`, which targets a different gateway; inline completions had been erroring the entire time. A mid-session experiment that *added* the `opencode/` prefix to the fetched list went the wrong way and was reverted.
**Reversibility:** easy to revert, but don't — the prefixed form is confirmed-rejected by this endpoint.

**Decision:** The panel auto-fetches the `/models` list once a key is set (on first state, key-set, or endpoint change), gated on origin change.
**Why:** the dropdown otherwise only filled on a manual ↻ button users didn't discover, so they only ever saw the single configured model. The origin gate prevents a refetch loop on an empty result and avoids re-firing on unrelated config pushes (model/enabled).
**Reversibility:** easy.
