# Side-panel implementation (post-review)

**Decision:** Config writes (`model`, `enabled`) target the scope that already defines the value (`inspect()` → WorkspaceFolder / Workspace / else Global), not always `ConfigurationTarget.Global`.
**Why:** a Global write under a workspace override is silently ineffective — the controlled panel select/checkbox would snap back. Surfaced by the multi-agent review.
**Reversibility:** easy.

**Decision:** `wisp.baseUrl` is `"scope": "machine"`.
**Why:** otherwise a malicious workspace could redirect requests — and the bearer API key — to an attacker endpoint. Side effect: baseUrl can no longer be set per-workspace (acceptable; it's near-constant).
**Reversibility:** easy (drop the scope line) but security-relevant — don't revert without reason.

**Decision:** `PanelState.keySource` is tri-state (`stored | env | none`), not a bare `keyIsSet` boolean; the webview Clear button is enabled only for `stored`.
**Why:** the `OPENCODE_API_KEY` env fallback made Clear look dead (deletes an absent secret, env key still resolves). Tri-state keeps the UI honest. Key value still never crosses to the webview.
**Reversibility:** easy.

**Decision:** No esbuild/webpack bundling — `vsce package` ships `openai` (and other prod `dependencies`) as-is.
**Why:** empirically verified the `.vsix` contains `node_modules/openai`; the prior "won't ship without bundling" assumption was false. Bundling stays a *size* optimization (1402 files), not a correctness requirement.
**Reversibility:** easy (add bundling later if package size matters).
