# Side-panel feature (planned)

10. **Panel scope = key + model + enabled toggle.** Other settings stay in `settings.json`. _Why:_ matches the ask plus the one cheap, useful toggle; avoids scope creep into a full control center.
11. **Model picker = live `/models` list + free-text override + refresh.** _Why:_ discovery without locking the user out of unadvertised ids; manual field still works without a valid key.
12. **Stack = Preact + Tailwind v4, bundled by Vite into one unhashed asset; deprecated webview-ui-toolkit avoided (theme via `--vscode-*` vars).**
13. **Key is write-only from the webview** — UI sends the key, receives only `keyIsSet`, never the value back.
14. **Tests marked for the pure modules M1 (suggestion cleanup) + M2 (completion context)** — see `PRD.md`. M3–M6 are VS Code/DOM glue → manual/integration verify.
15. **PRD delivered as `PRD.md` in-repo** (project is greenfield / non-git at decision time, so a local doc is the "copy", not a GitHub issue).
