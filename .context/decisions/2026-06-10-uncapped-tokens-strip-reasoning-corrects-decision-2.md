# Uncapped tokens + strip reasoning (corrects decision #2)

**Decision:** `maxTokens` default → `0` (uncapped); `max_tokens` is sent only when the setting is `>0`. A new `stripThink` step removes inline `<think>…</think>` reasoning from the completion before insertion (an unterminated `<think>` → insert nothing).
**Why:** the served models (minimax-m3, mimo, qwen3*, glm5*) are **reasoning models** that emit chain-of-thought inline as `<think>…</think>`. With the 64-token cap they burned the whole budget thinking and never produced code, and even non-reasoning output got truncated mid-line — both surfaced as "broken / unreliable autocomplete". Uncapping lets the answer finish; `stripThink` keeps the reasoning out of the ghost text. Tradeoff: reasoning models are slow per keystroke — a non-reasoning id (`deepseek-v4-flash`, `kimi-k2.6`) is the snappy choice.
**Reversibility:** easy (re-cap via the setting), but don't default it back — the cap is what made it unreliable.
