## [2.0.33] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Spurious `system_changed` STALE noise when advisor requests interleave (#158).**
  The advisor tool rides in the request's tools array, so advisor-on and advisor-off
  requests of one conversation are two cached prefix variants — but both shared one
  diagnosis chain, so the server compared each against the other variant's previous
  message and emitted verdicts the bill contradicted. The chain key now folds in the
  tool lineup's names (alongside model + first user turn); each variant chains its own
  previous message, and a variant-flip turn reads as the already-silent null-chain case.
- **STALE advisory states the observable, not one cause (#159).** The line asserted
  "concurrent send named an old previous_message_id", but a prefix-variant flip
  produces the identical bill-contradicts-verdict shape with no concurrency involved.
  It now reads "bill contradicts the verdict: stale compare target (concurrent send or
  prefix-variant flip)".

## [2.0.32] — 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- **Stale server miss verdicts now log as advisory, not MISS (#156).** Two concurrent
  sends can carry the same `previous_message_id` (the second fires before the first
  response's id lands in the chain), so the server diagnoses both against the pre-change
  message — live-captured as back-to-back identical verdicts, the second on a perfectly
  healthy turn. A real miss always surfaces in the bill (missed tokens re-write as
  `cache_creation` or bill as uncached input); a claimed `missed_input` more than double
  the billed total now logs as `prompt-cache diagnosis STALE … not a real miss` instead
  of a false `MISS (server)` line.

## [2.0.31] — 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- **False `prompt-cache MISS (server)` line on undiagnosable turns (#156).** Live
  capture: the backend can answer `cache_miss_reason: {type: 'unavailable'}`
  (missed=0) on a healthy-usage turn — "couldn't diagnose", not a break verdict.
  The diagnosis reader now folds `unavailable` into the no-diagnosis shape (the
  chain id is kept), so the usage heuristic stays the judge on undiagnosed turns.

## [2.0.30] — 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Server-side cache diagnostics on the Anthropic OAuth path (#156).** Every
  OAuth Messages request now rides the `cache-diagnosis-2026-04-07` beta and
  names its previous response id (`diagnostics.previous_message_id`, chained
  per conversation by the Bridge). When the backend diagnoses a broken cache
  prefix, the prompt-cache MISS line reports the server's authoritative
  reason and re-billed magnitude — e.g. `reason=system_changed
  missed_input=6594` — instead of only the usage-number inference. The
  existing heuristic stays as fallback (the server reports nothing on
  PARTIAL-shaped turns and unchained requests). Probe on #152 confirmed the
  subscription backend honors the beta; healthy turns still log nothing.

## [2.0.29] — 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- **Anthropic-door cache re-bill amplifier (#145).** Claude Code sends hook
  reminders as mid-conversation `role:"system"` turns; the door hoisted them
  into the top-level system slot, rendering them ahead of the entire message
  history — every new/changed reminder diverged the prompt right after the
  stable prefix and re-billed the whole history at the 2× cache-write rate
  (measured: a whole-history re-bill every ~7 bridged requests vs ~71 native;
  0.6–1.2M wasted write-tokens per heavy session). Reminders now stay
  positioned in `messages` as `role:"system"` text-block turns (the
  `mid-conversation-system-2026-04-07` beta claude CLI itself advertises), so
  reminder churn re-bills only the tail behind it. Non-Anthropic Targets are
  content-equivalent: OpenAI-compatible backends get the system message in
  place, Codex/xAI fold it into `instructions`.

### Added

- **`partial` cache outcome + advisory log line (#146).** The cache-health
  guard called any frame with a cache read a healthy `hit`, so the #145
  re-bills (8–11 per session, 34k–57k tokens each) never logged a line. A
  read with a ≥4k re-write behind it past the first exchange now logs one
  advisory `[bridge] prompt-cache PARTIAL … (#145)` line next to the existing
  MISS line; healthy sessions still log nothing.

## [2.0.28] — 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Advisor reviewer cost is now visible to Claude Code (#143).** The door runs
  the advisor reviewer itself, but its token usage was discarded — `/cost` and
  session totals under-reported every bridged session that consulted the
  advisor. The reviewer sub-call's real usage now rides out on the closing
  usage frame as openclaude-style `usage.iterations` entries
  (`advisor_message` with the resolved Target model + token counts, then the
  final base pass as the last entry — the slot Claude Code reads as the
  authoritative context window). Live-verified: Claude Code folds the advisor
  tokens into `modelUsage` and `total_cost_usd`. Entries are honest: a
  reviewer Target that reports no usage is omitted rather than logged as
  zeros, plain turns emit no `iterations` at all, and top-level usage (what
  the #111 cache-health guard reads) stays the base pass's alone.

## [2.0.27] — 2026-07-21

### Changed

- **Advisor reviewer transcript is now prompt-cacheable (#141).** The reviewer
  sub-call used to flatten the whole conversation into one text block that grew
  every invocation — zero cache reuse, full re-bill per advisor call. The
  transcript now rides as one text block per serialized turn (`textBlocks` on
  the normalized turn; Anthropic body builder emits per-entry blocks, the
  existing breakpoint walk marks them), so successive advisor calls read the
  shared prefix from cache. Non-Anthropic advisor Targets are unaffected (they
  read the joined text, unchanged).

## [2.0.26] — 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- **Advisor reviewer quarantine restored (#142, a #139 regression in 2.0.25).**
  The reviewer sub-call inherited the new `systemSplit` from the base request,
  and the Anthropic arm preferred it over the quarantine frame — so on
  marker-carrying sessions (every bridged Claude Code session) the reviewer
  received the client's full system prompt instead of `reviewerSystem()`. The
  reviewer request is now built by an explicit, unit-tested
  `buildReviewerRequest` (quarantine system, split stripped, no tools).

## [2.0.25] — 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- **Bridged Claude Code sessions no longer re-bill the whole prompt-cache prefix
  when a `<system-reminder>` lands mid-session (#139).** The Anthropic door used
  to fold every system block into one joined string with its only cache marker at
  the end — each appended reminder mutated the marked block and re-billed the
  entire tools+system+history prefix as `cache_creation` (the observed quota
  spikes). The door now splits at the client's own `cache_control` marker: the
  stable prefix keeps the breakpoint, the volatile tail rides after it as an
  unmarked block, matching native Claude Code's layout. Verified live: a changed
  reminder now re-bills only itself (read 9,385 / write 87 where the old shape
  was read 0 / write 9,400+).
- **The #111 cache-MISS log line now catches the creation-shaped bust.** A
  multi-turn request that read nothing while re-writing a ≥4k-token prefix logs a
  MISS even when `input_tokens` stays tiny.

## [2.0.24] — 2026-07-20

### Added

- **`wisp snapshot` / `wisp snapshot revert` — row-based Routing-map snapshots.**
  Record what a fixed Family route or user Alias points at, and restore it on
  revert. Command decisions live in `@wisp/core` (`runSnapshotCommand`, pure) with
  a thin TUI fs+console edge; the store round-trips in `~/.wisp/config.json`.
  `snapshot` refuses a row already held (the only safety rail); `revert` is
  unconditional and prints the overwritten value.
- **Tab completes the highlighted slash command.** A pure `completeSlash` beside
  `suggestSlash`; Tab fills the command but never runs it, adding a trailing space
  only when the command declares args.
- **Drag-select copy now flashes "Copied to clipboard."** A feedback-row note
  appears after a successful copy; the ~1.5 s clear is generation-gated so a newer
  status (or a second copy) wins over a stale timer.

### Changed

- **The `/bridge` wisp-slot blurb is now a why-explanation.** Claude Code only
  knows Claude names; the plugin bridges that gap. Install line and gold nudge
  color unchanged.
- **The `wisp-slot` plugin goes CLI-native (v1.3.0).** It drives
  `wisp snapshot` / `wisp snapshot revert` instead of hand-written
  `~/.claude/slot/lease-*.json` files; the SessionStart hook and statusline read
  held rows from the Wisp snapshot store, and the badge marker becomes `!SNAP`.
  Requires wisp-router 2.0.24+. The word "lease" retires from the plugin.

## [2.0.23] — 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **`/show-log` no longer clips long lines.** Route and messages lines were painted
  with `wrapMode="none"`, so anything past the panel edge (the model id on a
  `[bridge] route …` line, the image count on `messages …`) vanished. Lines are
  hand-wrapped with the same `wrapWords` helper the rest of the TUI uses, so the
  full text stays readable inside the scrollbox.

### Changed

- **Model-swap lines stand out in `/show-log`.** Lines that start with
  `[bridge] route ` render in a sky accent (`LOG_ROUTE`); other traffic stays dim.
- **The wisp-slot plugin recommend blurb on `/bridge` is gold (`#D59D24`).** The
  advisor note under it stays dim so the install nudge is the one that pops.
- **Drag-selecting text copies it to the clipboard.** opentui already painted the
  highlight; the shell now listens for finished selections and copies via OSC 52,
  falling back to `clip.exe` on Windows when the terminal rejects OSC 52.

## [2.0.22] — 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **The native Advisor no longer 400s mid-turn on a real session.**
  `buildAnthropicMessagesBody` placed its #111 cache-control breakpoints by mutating
  the caller's `rawContent` thinking-sidecar array in place. The advisor flow builds the
  request up to three times from the *same* turns (base pass → reviewer → continuation),
  so a breakpoint written on one build leaked back into the turns and stacked on the next
  — eventually exceeding Anthropic's cap ("A maximum of 4 blocks with cache_control may be
  provided. Found 5.") and tearing the stream with a mid-response error. Replayed thinking
  sidecars are now copied, with any `cache_control` stripped (Anthropic rejects it on
  thinking blocks regardless), so every build is independent and the marker count stays
  within the cap.
- **The Advisor reviewer no longer echoes the conversation instead of reviewing it.** The
  reviewer sub-call forwarded the base model's entire system prompt — including Claude
  Code's own `# Advisor Tool` instructions — plus the raw turns, so a reviewer (even real
  Opus) could parrot those meta-instructions back rather than give a second opinion. The
  reviewer now gets a dedicated, quarantined system prompt and the conversation flattened
  into a single plain-text transcript (structured tool / thinking / image blocks removed),
  which also keeps its request well under the cache cap. The reviewer is text-only as a
  result — pasted images are summarized as `[N image(s) omitted]`.

## [2.0.21] — 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Claude Code's native Advisor now works through the Bridge.** The Advisor is a
  server-executed tool: the model emits an `advisor` call and waits for the *server*
  to run a stronger reviewer and hand back the verdict. Through Wisp the server is the
  Bridge — which never played that role, so the call dangled and the model reported
  "advisor tool not there." The Anthropic door now fulfills it: it forwards an
  `advisor` tool to the base Target, and when the Target calls it, runs a separate
  reviewer pass over the conversation (the model chosen in `/advisor`, routed through
  your Routing map — any Target can advise any other), streams the result back for the
  native Advisor UI, then resumes the base turn with the advice in context. The
  `claude-wisp` launcher and the copy-paste setup snippets now set
  `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_ADVISOR_TOOL=1` so `/advisor` is offered for the
  `claude-wisp-*` model aliases (which carry no advisor rank in Claude Code's catalog,
  the client-side gate that otherwise keeps the tool from ever being sent). The old
  `/bridge` and side-panel warning that the Advisor was "endpoint-gated, use native
  claude" is removed — that root cause was wrong; a Bridge session is first-party, and
  the only missing piece was Wisp playing the server role.

## [2.0.20] — 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Anthropic cache TTL no longer flips mid-session** — the cache TTL on the #111
  breakpoints was derived from this request's turn count (`≥ 2` turns → `1h`, else
  `5m`), so turn 1 of a bridged session wrote `5m` and turn 2 flipped to `1h`. A TTL
  change rewrites `cache_control` and busts the server-side prompt cache, re-billing
  the whole system+tools prefix at the 2× write rate on turn 2 of **every** session.
  The TTL is now fixed per request **path**: `anthropicStream` (Bridge sessions +
  native chat) → `1h`, `anthropicInquire` (one-shot) → `5m`, haiku always `5m`. The
  #111 breakpoint placement is unchanged — only the TTL value moved from turn-count to
  call-path.

### Added

- **`prompt-cache MISS` log on the Bridge's Anthropic door** — a pure
  `anthropicCacheOutcome` classifier (`hit`/`fresh`/`miss`/`none`) over the wire's
  token usage; the door logs one line when a past-first-exchange request reads nothing
  from cache while billing a large uncached input (the #111 regression shape). The
  observability that cache regression previously had none of.

## [2.0.19] — 2026-07-18

### Changed

- **Cheaper cache writes on one-shot Anthropic bodies** — Inquire / probe / first-turn
  requests now place bare `{ type: 'ephemeral' }` markers (5-minute TTL, 1.25× write
  cost). Multi-turn bodies (`≥ 2` user/assistant turns after system strip) still use
  `ttl: '1h'` so an idle gap mid-session doesn't force a full prefix rewrite. The
  #111 breakpoints themselves are unchanged — only the TTL on them is conditional.

## [2.0.18] — 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Real token usage on the Anthropic door** — the Bridge used to synthesize
  `usage: { input_tokens: 0, output_tokens: 0 }`, so the wisped client's token/cost
  meter read zeros and cache reads were invisible. The backend's real usage now rides
  end-to-end: the door forwards the live `message_start` snapshot (real input +
  `cache_creation` / `cache_read`) and the final `message_delta` counts instead of
  fabricating them. A warm bridged call now surfaces its true `cache_read` on the
  client meter — which also makes the always-1h cache write premium measurable for the
  first time.

## [2.0.17] — 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Thinking passthrough on the Anthropic door** — `thinking` / `redacted_thinking`
  blocks now round-trip client ↔ Anthropic instead of dying inside the Bridge in both
  directions. Outbound: a thinking-bearing assistant turn keeps its original block
  array as a byte-for-byte sidecar and replays it verbatim (signatures + interleaved
  order intact; the client's own `cache_control` markers are shed so Wisp's breakpoint
  budget holds). Inbound: the door's SSE encoder and non-streaming reply forward
  thinking block starts, deltas, signatures, and redacted blocks live — including the
  OAuth wire's empty-text signed thinking blocks. Tool calls now yield at their stream
  position (not folded at stream end) so interleaved thinking order survives the round
  trip. A thinking-only turn is delivered content, not an "empty response" 502.
  Non-Anthropic targets and the OpenAI door drop thinking silently, as with images.
- **Claude 5 effort support** — `claude-fable-5` / `claude-sonnet-5` now receive
  adaptive thinking + `output_config.effort` (live-probed: accepted through `xhigh`
  and `max`). Previously the effort regexes predated Claude 5, so /effort was silently
  dropped on the default model — which also kept the thinking replay gate closed there.

## [2.0.16] — 2026-07-18

### Added

- **PDF passthrough on the Anthropic door** — base64 `document` blocks (a dragged-in
  PDF, or Claude Code's Read on a PDF returning pages inside `tool_result` content)
  now ride through the Bridge to Anthropic backends instead of silently vanishing
  from the conversation. Anthropic-door only: a PDF routed to a Codex/xAI/Go target
  is still dropped (those backends don't accept them).

## [2.0.15] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- **Cache breakpoints spread across fat tool turns** — Anthropic's cache lookback only
  reaches ~20 content blocks back from a marker, so a heavy parallel-tool turn overshot
  the window and silently re-billed the conversation prefix. The Bridge now walks the
  message history placing a marker every ~15 blocks (within the 4-per-request budget);
  short conversations emit the same single end-of-history marker as before. A marker due
  at a bare-string chat turn slides forward to the nearest markable block, so runs of
  plain turns can't widen a gap past the lookback window. (#111 follow-up)
- **1h cache TTL on Anthropic breakpoints** — reconstructed markers used the 5-minute
  default, so a bridged session's cached prefix expired over an idle gap and re-wrote on
  return. Now `ttl: '1h'`, matching native Claude Code over OAuth.
- **`tool_result.is_error` passthrough** — a failed tool call's explicit error flag now
  rides through the Anthropic door instead of being dropped in normalization.

## [2.0.14] — 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Bridge screen recommends the `wisp-slot` Claude Code plugin** — a nudge where Claude
  Code gets wired, so users learn bridged sessions can get the session announcement, the
  `[WISP]` statusline badge, and the Slot skill
  (`/plugin marketplace add EstarinAzx/Wisp-Router`).

## [2.0.13] — 2026-07-17

### Added

- **`/bridge` ensure-on + `/bridge off`** — `/bridge` starts the listener when it's down
  instead of only reporting it, and `/bridge off` stops it from the palette. (#121)
- **`/show-log` — the Bridge log Screen** — a ring buffer captures Bridge traffic lines;
  the Screen tails them with auto-follow and scroll-to-pause. (#122)
- **Headless `wisp providers` + `wisp models <provider>`** — catalog and live model
  snapshots from the command line, no TUI entered. (#123)

## [2.0.12] — 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Mouse on selects** — draggable scrollbar (captured at mousedown, 2-cell grab zone),
  wheel scroll, and row click.
- **Span-diff baseline harness** — renders every Screen and diffs styled spans against
  committed baselines, guarding the split below. (#115)

### Changed

- **TUI split into Screen modules** — modes/theme/widgets foundations, provider flows,
  routing flows, palette/test/info Screens; `app.tsx` is the shell only. Internal
  refactor, behaviour unchanged. (#114, #116–#119)

### Fixed

- **Transparent select backgrounds** — native selects match the hand-rolled WrapSelect
  look instead of painting an opaque slab.

## [2.0.11] — 2026-07-17

### Added

- **`wisp routing` CLI** — headless text/JSON snapshots of the Routing map (#108), plus
  validated `routing set` / `routing unset` writes for Family routes and Aliases; accepted
  edits persist atomically, missing credentials warn without refusing. (#112)
